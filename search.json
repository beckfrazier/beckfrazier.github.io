    "text": "Hey y’all! I’m Beck Frazier!\nI’m a sports broadcaster at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln at the College of Journalism and Mass Communications. I am also the Assistant Sports Director for KRNU Sports.\nI’ve had the pleasure of being a Play-By-Play and Color broadcaster across multiple sports for 90.3 KNRU and KRNU2. A new role I started this year was being a studio host for 90.3 KRNU during Husker football games. I’ve also made appearances on Big Ten Plus for women’s soccer, softball, and baseball.\nI’ve also had the opportunity to produce various broadcasts for 90.3 KRNU and KRNU2. Also new for this year, I was able to TD a Nebraska Softball game and produce a Husker Hockey game for Nebraska News Service.\nIn the summer I’ve spent time working as a member of the Werner Park Grounds Crew. I’ve held this position since 2021 and have worked on both baseball and soccer fields for the Omaha Storm Chasers and Union Omaha."
